skysh {version}
Sayan N. <ohsayan@outlook.com>
The Skytable interactive shell (skysh)

USAGE:
    skysh [OPTIONS]

FLAGS:
    --help          Diplays this help message
    --version       Displays the shell version

OPTIONS:
    --endpoint      Set the endpoint for the connection
    --user          Set the user for this client session
    --password      Set the password for this client session
    --tls-cert      Set the TLS certificate to use (for TLS endpoints)
    --eval, -e      Execute and print the query (password must be set)

NOTES:
    - If no password is supplied, we look for the `{password_env_var}`
      environment variable
    - When no endpoint is specified, skysh will attempt to connect to the default
    TCP endpoint `{default_tcp_endpoint}`
    - When no user is specified, skysh will attempt to authenticate as root
    - All connections need an username and password. If this is not provided
    via arguments, it will be asked for interactively
    - Endpoints are specified using the Skytable endpoint syntax. For example,
    the default TCP endpoint is `{default_tcp_endpoint}` while the default TLS
    endpoint is `{default_tls_endpoint}`
    - If you choose to use a TLS endpoint, you must provide a certificate.
    Failing to do so will throw an error, as expected
    - All history is stored in the `.sky_history` file, in the user's home directory unless
      otherwise configured using the `SKYSH_HISTORY_FILE` environment variable. If you wish
      to delete your shell history, simply remove the file
