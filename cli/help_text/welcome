Welcome to the Skytable Interactive shell (REPL environment).

Here are a few tips to help you get started:
- Skytable uses its own query language called BlueQL. It is mostly like SQL
but with some important changes for security
- Since BlueQL doesn't need a query terminator ';' you do not need to use it
here for running queries
- You might be surprised to see that you can use literals in this REPL while
Skytable does not allow the use of literals for security concerns. This is
because whenever you run a query, the REPL turns it into a parameterized query.
- You can also run some `skysh` specific commands:
    - `!help` displays this help message
    - `clear` clears the terminal screen
    - `exit` exits the REPL session

Now, it's time to get querying!
