Skytable benchmark tool

USAGE:
    sky-bench [OPTIONS]

FLAGS:
    --help      Displays this help message
    --version   Displays the benchmark tool version

REQUIRED OPTIONS:
    --password  Provide the password

OPTIONS:
    --endpoint    Set the endpoint (defaults to {default_tcp_endpoint})
    --threads     Set the number of threads to be used (defaults to logical
                  CPU count)
    --connections Set the number of connections. Defaults to 8 x logical CPU
                  count. Only supported by the `fury` engine.
    --keysize     Set the default primary key size. defaults to 7
    --rowcount    Set the number of rows to be manipulated for the benchmark
                  Defaults to 1,000,000 rows.
    --workload    Set the workload to run (see below).
    --engine      (DEPRECATED) Set the engine for benchmarking. `rookie` is the stable engine
                  and `fury` is the new experimental engine. Defaults to `fury`

WORKLOADS:
- 'std_uniform_v1': (current default) This real-world workload creates and manipulates unique
                    rows with an uniform distribution of executed queries

NOTES:
    - If no password is supplied, we look for the `{password_env_var}`
      environment variable
    - The user for auth will be 'root' since only 'root' accounts allow the
      creation and deletion of spaces and models
    - A space called 'bench' will be created
    - A model called 'bench' will be created in the space
      created above. The created model has the structure {un: string, pw: uint8}
    - The model and space will be removed once the benchmark is complete
