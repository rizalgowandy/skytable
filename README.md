## What is Skytable?

Skytable is a **NoSQL database** implemented using modern design paradigms, that focuses on **performance, flexibility, and scalability**.

Skytable is primarily in-memory, uses multithreaded asynchronous I/O and a custom AOF-based storage engine with advanced delayed durability transactions for efficient disk I/O. Skytable's data model is based on a column-oriented structure with support for additional data models<sup>(WIP)</sup>. Querying is done using BlueQL, a SQL-based query language hardened against injection attacks, written specifically for Skytable.

Skytable is best-suited for applications that need to store large-scale data, need high-performance and low latencies.

> **You can read more about Skytable's architecture, including information on the clustering and HA implementation that we're currently working on, and limitations [on this page](https://docs.skytable.io/architecture).**

## Features

- **Spaces, models and more**: For flexible data definition
- **Powerful querying with BlueQL**: A modern query language based on SQL
- **Rich data modeling**: Use `model`s to define data with complex types, collections and more
- **Performant**: Optimized multithreaded network I/O, write batching and several other optimizations
- **Secure**: Injection deterrence using BlueQL and other memory safety measures
- **Enforces best practices**: If you're building with Skytable today, the practices you'll get used to here will let you easily take on the job of building performant systems, even outside Skytable

> Learn more about [Skytable's features here](https://docs.skytable.io).

## Getting started

1. **Set up Skytable on your machine**: You'll need to download a bundled release file [from the releases page](https://github.com/skytable/skytable/releases). Unzip the files and you're ready to go.
2. Start the database server: `./skyd --auth-root-password <password>` with your choice of a password for the `root` account. The `root` account is just like a `root` account on Unix based systems that has control over everything.
3. Start the interactive client REPL: `./skysh` and then enter your password.
4. Your setup is now complete.

## Using Skytable

Skytable has `SPACE`s instead of `DATABASE`s due to signficant operational differences (and because `SPACE`s store a lot more than tabular data).

**With the REPL started, follow this guide**:

1. Create a `space` and switch to it:

   ```sql
   CREATE SPACE myspace
   USE myspace
   ```

2. Create a `model`:

   ```sql
   CREATE MODEL myspace.mymodel(username: string, password: string, notes: list { type: string })
   ```

   The rough representation for this in Rust would be:

   ```rust
   pub struct MyModel {
    username: String,
    password: String,
    notes: Vec<String>,
   }
   ```

3. `INSERT` some data:

   ```sql
   INSERT INTO mymodel('sayan', 'pass123', [])
   ```

4. `UPDATE` some data:

   ```sql
   UPDATE mymodel SET notes += "my first note" WHERE username = 'sayan'
   ```

5. `SELECT` some data

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM mymodel WHERE username = 'sayan'
   ```

6. Modify and run your own queries to understand how things work. **And then make sure you [read the documentation learn BlueQL](https://docs.skytable.io/blueql/overview).**

> **For a complete guide on Skytable, it's architecture, BlueQL, queries and more we strongly recommend you to [read the documentation here.](https://docs.skytable.io)**
>
> While you're seeing strings and other values being used here, this is so because the REPL client smartly parameterizes queries behind the scenes. **BlueQL has mandatory parameterization**. (See below to see how the Rust client handles this)

## Find a client driver

You need a client driver to use Skytable in your programs. Officially, we maintain a regularly updated [Rust client driver](https://github.com/skytable/client-rust) which is liberally license under the Apache-2.0 license so that you can use it anywhere.

Using the Rust client driver, it's very straightforward to run queries thanks to Rust's powerful type system and macros:

```rust
use skytable::{Config, query};

fn main() {
    let mut db = Config::new_default("username", "password").connect().unwrap();
    let query = query!("select username, password from myspace.mymodel where username = ?", "sayan");
    let (username, password): (String, Vec<u8>) = db.query_parse(&query).unwrap();
    // do something with it
}
```

> **You can find more information on client drivers on [this page](https://docs.skytable.io/libraries). If you want to help write a client driver for your language of choice, *we're here to support your work*. Please reach out to: <hey@skytable.io> or leave a message on our Discord server.**
